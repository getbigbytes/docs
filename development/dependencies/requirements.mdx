## Add Python packages to `requirements.txt`

### Location

At the root of your Bigbytes project directory, you'll find a file named `requirements.txt`.
This file is used to specify all the Python packages that your project depends on.

### Path

At the root of your project directory, there is a file named `requirements.txt`. Open this file
and add the Python package you want installed and available throughout your entire project.

For example, if your project is named `demo_project` then the file will be located at
`demo_project/requirements.txt`.

### Adding packages

To add a package, simply open the `requirements.txt` file and list each package on a new line. You can also specify version requirements if needed.

### Example `requirements.txt`:

```
matplotlib==3.5.2
tqdm
```
In this example the `requirements.txt` file will install:

- matplotlib version 3.5.2
- tqdm

## Automatic installation

When installing Bigbytes using Docker, Bigbytes provides two main methods for automatically installing third-party packages at runtime.
These methods utilize the `USER_CODE_PATH` environment variable, which defines your project path (e.g. `/home/src/project_name`),
to locate your `requirements.txt` file and install the packages listed there.

<Accordion title="Using Command Line Flags">

## Using command line flags

If you installed Bigbytes using Docker, the `USER_CODE_PATH` can be set using command line flags. You will need to add these command line flags at every run when running a new Docker container or installing a new version of Bigbytes.

### Setting `USER_CODE_PATH` in Docker

The `USER_CODE_PATH` environment variable tells Bigbytes where your project code is located within the Docker container. This is essential for features like automatic package installation from `requirements.txt`.

#### Docker run command

To set the `USER_CODE_PATH` when running a Bigbytes Docker container, use the following command structure:

```Shell
docker run -it -p 6789:6789 -v $(pwd):/home/src \
  -e USER_CODE_PATH=/home/src/project_name \
  getbigbytes/bigbytes /app/run_app.sh bigbytes start [project_name]
```
Let's break down this command:

- `it`: Runs the container interactively with a pseudo-TTY.
- `p 6789:6789`: Maps port 6789 from the container to your host machine.
- `v $(pwd):/home/src`: Mounts your current directory to `/home/src` in the container.
- `e USER_CODE_PATH=/home/src/project_name`: Sets the `USER_CODE_PATH` environment variable.
- `getbigbytes/bigbytes`: Specifies the Bigbytes Docker image to use.
- `/app/run_app.sh bigbytes start [project_name]`: The command to run inside the container.

### Important Notes

1. **Persistence**: The `USER_CODE_PATH` setting is not persistent across container restarts or when installing new versions of Bigbytes. You must include these flags each time you run a new Docker container.
2. **Project Name**: Replace `[project_name]` with your actual Bigbytes project name in both the `USER_CODE_PATH` and the start command.
3. **Path Consistency**: Ensure that the path in `USER_CODE_PATH` matches the mount point specified in the `v` flag. In this example, we mount to `/home/src`, so the `USER_CODE_PATH` starts with `/home/src`.
4. **Working Directory**: The `$(pwd)` in the `v` flag assumes you're running the Docker command from your project's parent directory. Adjust this path if you're running from a different location.

<Accordion title="Using Dockerfile">

## Using Dockerfiles

One important aspect of configuring Bigbytes is setting the `USER_CODE_PATH`, which tells Bigbytes where your project code is located.
While this can be done using command-line flags when running Docker containers, it's also possible to set the `USER_CODE_PATH`
directly in your Dockerfile. This approach can be more convenient for consistent deployments and when building custom images.

```Bash
FROM getbigbytes/bigbytes:latest

### Set up project-specific arguments
ARG PROJECT_NAME=[project_name]
ARG BIGBYTES_CODE_PATH=/home/mage_code
ARG USER_CODE_PATH=${BIGBYTES_CODE_PATH}/${PROJECT_NAME}

### Set working directory
WORKDIR ${BIGBYTES_CODE_PATH}

### Copy project files
COPY ${PROJECT_NAME} ${PROJECT_NAME}

### Set the command to run on container startup
CMD ["/bin/sh", "-c", "/app/run_app.sh"]
```

Breakdown of the Dockerfile:

1. `FROM getbigbytes/bigbytes:latest`
    - Specifies the base image as the latest version of the official Bigbytes image.
2. Project-specific arguments:

```Bash
ARG PROJECT_NAME=[project_name]
ARG BIGBYTES_CODE_PATH=/home/mage_code
ARG USER_CODE_PATH=${BIGBYTES_CODE_PATH}/${PROJECT_NAME}
```
- `PROJECT_NAME`: Should be replaced with your actual project name.
- `BIGBYTES_CODE_PATH`: Sets the base path for Bigbytes code.
- `USER_CODE_PATH`: Constructs the full path to your project, effectively setting the `USER_CODE_PATH` for Bigbytes.
3. `WORKDIR ${BIGBYTES_CODE_PATH}`
    - Sets the working directory inside the container to the path specified by `BIGBYTES_CODE_PATH`.
4. `COPY ${PROJECT_NAME} ${PROJECT_NAME}`
    - Copies your project files from the host machine into the container.
5. `CMD ["/bin/sh", "-c", "/app/run_app.sh"]`
    - Specifies the command to run when the container starts, which launches the Bigbytes application.

To use this Dockerfile:

1. Replace `[project_name]` with your actual project name.
2. Ensure your project files are in a directory named after your project.
3. Build the Docker image using this Dockerfile.
4. Run the container to start your Bigbytes environment.

This Dockerfile demonstrates how to set the `USER_CODE_PATH` using build arguments. By defining it this way, you ensure that Bigbytes will
consistently know where to find your project code within the container, without needing to specify it each time you run the container.

Follow the [Repository setup](https://docs.getbigbytes.com/production/ci-cd/local-cloud/repository-setup) documentation to deploy this
Dockerfile to fully automate the installation of third-party Python pacakges.

If you’re running Bigbytes using pip or conda, your local machine’s environment variables are accessible within the running Bigbytes app.

### Prerequisites

1. Ensure that the environment variable `USER_CODE_PATH` is set to your project path, using
the command line flags or the Dockerfile methods.

      Example: `/home/src/project_name`

2. Bigbytes uses a script named `run_app.sh` to manage the application startup process.

### Installation process

When you start your Bigbytes server:

1. The `run_app.sh` script checks the `USER_CODE_PATH` environment variable.
2. It locates the `requirements.txt` file within the specified project directory.
3. All packages listed in `requirements.txt` are automatically installed before the server starts.

This ensures that all required packages are available for your project and pipelines.
