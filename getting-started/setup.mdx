## ‚õµÔ∏è Overview

We recommend using Docker to get started.

Docker is a tool that allows you to run Bigbytes in a containerized environment: you can run Bigbytes on any operating system that supports Docker, including Windows, Mac, and Linux. Using Docker means that you don't have to worry about installing dependencies or configuring your environment. If you'd like to install Bigbytes without Docker, you can use `pip` or `conda`.

If you're familiar with [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) or plan on adding or extending images (e.g. Postgres) in your project, we recommend starting from the _Docker compose template_. Otherwise, we recommend _Docker run_.

## ü™Ñ Get Bigbytes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Docker" icon="docker">

    ### Get started

    First, be sure [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) is installed. Next, create a new folder for your project, change directory into that folder, and run the following from your terminal:

    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash Mac/Linux
      docker run -it -p 6789:6789 -v $(pwd):/home/src getbigbytes/bigbytes /app/run_app.sh bigbytes start [project_name]
      ```
      ```bash Windows Command Line
      docker run -it -p 6789:6789 -v "%cd%:/home/src" getbigbytes/bigbytes /app/run_app.sh bigbytes start [project_name]
      ```

      ```bash PowerShell
      docker run -it -p 6789:6789 -v ${PWD}:/home/src getbigbytes/bigbytes /app/run_app.sh bigbytes start [project_name]
      ```

      ```bash GCP VM Instance
      sudo docker run -it -p 6789:6789 -v $(pwd):/home/src getbigbytes/bigbytes /app/run_app.sh bigbytes start [project_name]
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

    Once the server is running, open `http://localhost:6789` in your browser and explore! If using any cloud provider use external IP address with the port eg 123.456.78:6789. We recommend one of our [guides](/guides/overview) for inspiration.

    ### What's happening?

    We're executing `docker run`, which runs a Docker container from the Bigbytes image. additionally, we're _mounting a volume_ (the `-v` command) to persist our project files on our container. This mounts the current folder to `/home/src` in the bigbytes container. We're executing our docker image `getbigbytes/bigbytes` and running a script to start up the container.

  <Accordion title="Docker Compose" icon="Docker">
    ### Get started

    The following is useful if you plan on customizing your image or adding additional services to a Docker network with Bigbytes. Read more about Docker compose [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

    Be sure that [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) are installed and run:
    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash Mac/Linux
      git clone https://github.com/getbigbytes/compose-quickstart.git bigbytes-quickstart \
      && cd bigbytes-quickstart \
      && cp dev.env .env && rm dev.env \
      && docker compose up
      ```

      ```bash Windows
      git clone https://github.com/getbigbytes/compose-quickstart.git bigbytes-quickstart
      cd bigbytes-quickstart
      cp dev.env .env
      rm dev.env
      docker compose up
      ```

      ```Windows powershell/cmd
      git clone https://github.com/getbigbytes/compose-quickstart.git bigbytes-quickstart
      cd bigbytes-quickstart
      copy dev.env .env
      del dev.env
      docker compose up
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

    Once the server is running, open `http://localhost:6789` in your browser and explore! We recommend one of our [guides](/guides/overview) to for inspiration.

    ### What's happening?

    We're cloning our Docker Compose [quickstart repo](https://github.com/getbigbytes/compose-quickstart.git), copying `dev.env` to `.env`, which is ignored by git in our configuration (to avoid exposing secrets), then running `docker compose up` to start a Bigbytes server.

        <Step title="Download and update Kubernetes config file">
          First, download the Bigbytes Kubernetes config file [here](https://github.com/getbigbytes/bigbytes/blob/master/kube/app.yaml).
          Then, replace the `/path/to/bigbytes_project` in the config yaml with the path that you want to use to store your Bigbytes projects.
        </Step>
        <Step title="Run Bigbytes app in Kubernetes cluster">
          Install the command line tool, [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl), if you haven't already.
          Run the command `kubectl create -f kube/app.yaml` to run Bigbytes in a Kubernetes pod. You can check the pod status with command `kubectl get pods -o wide`.
          Set up port forwarding with command `kubectl port-forward bigbytes-server 6789:6789`.
