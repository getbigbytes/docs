By default, the official Bigbytes docker images in DockerHub are using the root users. For production deployment,
it's recommended to use non-root users in the docker image to restrict access to the system for better security.
Here is the Dockerfile template that you can use to build your custom docker image that runs Bigbytes as non-root user.

```dockerfile
ARG VERSION

FROM getbigbytes/bigbytes:$VERSION

# Add non-root user for Bigbytes service
RUN adduser --disabled-password --gecos '' bigbytes && adduser bigbytes bigbytes

# Grant the user permissions to the Bigbytes related directories
RUN mkdir /home/src/bigbytes_data; chown -R bigbytes /home/src/bigbytes_data
RUN mkdir /home/src/default_repo; chown -R bigbytes /home/src/default_repo

RUN pip3 install -r path/to/requirements.txt

# Set the Bigbytes user
USER bigbytes

ENV PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:/home/bigbytes/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages"

WORKDIR /home/src

CMD ["/bin/sh", "-c", "/app/run_app.sh"]
```
