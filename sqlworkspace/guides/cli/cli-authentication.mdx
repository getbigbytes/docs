## Login[](#login "Direct link to Login")

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="1\. If you use your email + password in the browser, login with your email and password.">
  To login to your Bigbytes instance run the following command and provide your login email and password:

```
bigbytes login https://{{ bigbytes_domain }}

```

where `{{ bigbytes_domain }}` is the address for your running Bigbytes instance. For example Bigbytes cloud users in the US would type `bigbytes login https://app.bigbytes.cloud` if you're in Europe you'd type`bigbytes login https://eu1.bigbytes.cloud`.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="2\. If you use single sign-on (SSO) in the browser, login with a personal access token.">
First, you'll need to create a new personal access token in the UI by going to Settings > Personal Access Tokens. You can't use an existing personal access token! You have to create a new one just for yourself.

</Frame>

Then, run the following command in your project:

```
bigbytes login https://{{ bigbytes_domain }} --token

```

where `https://my-bigbytes.domain.com` is the address for your running Bigbytes instance. For example Bigbytes cloud users in the US would type `bigbytes login https://app.bigbytes.cloud` if you're in Europe you'd type`bigbytes login https://eu1.bigbytes.cloud`.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="3\. If you're running in a CI/CD pipeline, login with environment variables">
You can use the following environment variables to authenticate yourself on each command:

* **BIGBYTES\_API\_KEY** a personal access token you can generate in the app under the user settings
* **BIGBYTES\_URL** address for your running Bigbytes instance
* **BIGBYTES\_PROXY\_AUTHORIZATION** if your Bigbytes instance is behind a proxy like [Cloud IAP](https://cloud.google.com/iap) you can set here `Proxy-Authentication` header value

Example:

```
BIGBYTES_API_KEY=946fedb74003405646867dcacf1ad345 BIGBYTES_URL="https://{{ bigbytes_domain }}" BIGBYTES_PROXY_AUTHORIZATION="Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>" bigbytes preview

```

Where `{{ bigbytes_domain }}` is your domain. For Bigbytes Cloud users use `https://app.bigbytes.cloud`

## Set active project[](#set-active-project "Direct link to Set active project")

When you login you'll be asked to set an active project.

Your active project is just the one that you're working on/developing in. Your organization might just have one project, so that makes your decision easy!

You can change your active project by running:

```
bigbytes config set-project

```

Or you can use the `BIGBYTES_PROJECT` environment variable to indicate what project UUID the command should use.

Example:

```
BIGBYTES_PROJECT="3675b69e-8324-4110-bdca-059031aa8da3" bigbytes deploy

```

You can see all of the actions available on the CLI by typing this in your terminal:

```

```
