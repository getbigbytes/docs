## Global options

There are three global options that can be used with any Bigbytes CLI command: [version](#version), [help](#help), and [verbose](#verbose).

### Version

`--version` or `-V`

Ignores the preceding command and shows the installed CLI version. Usually it's used right after `bigbytes`, like this:

```
bigbytes --version
```

### Help

`--help` or `-h`

Tells you what the preceding command does and lists all command-specific options. You can view the Bigbytes CLI help like this:

```
bigbytes --help
```

That returns the Bigbytes CLI help menu:

   <img src="/images/references/cli-bigbytes-help-86d9d11f57ca516a722c0dfcf8f2919a.png"/>
</Frame>


When you use the `--help` or `-h` option with a speific command:

```
bigbytes validate -h
```

That returns details and examples for the command itself:

</Frame>
### Verbose

`--verbose`

Defaults to OFF. When included, each step will print logs as it progresses through the command. For example, here's a `--verbose` version of `bigbytes generate-exposures`:

### `bigbytes login`

Log in to a Bigbytes instance using email and password or a token.

```
bigbytes login [URL]
```

**Argument:**

* `[URL]`
   * The URL for your Bigbytes instance (see examples below)

**Options:**

* `--token`
   * For logging in with an access token (common for SSO users)
   * Exclude this to log in with email and password

**Examples:**

Log in to Bigbytes Cloud US instance (for most Starter customers):

```
bigbytes login https://app.bigbytes.cloud
```

Log in to Bigbytes Cloud EU instance while showing detailed logs of login process:

```
bigbytes login https://eu1.bigbytes.cloud --verbose
```

Log in to a custom domain with a personal access token (exclude `--token` to log in with email and password):

```
bigbytes login https://custom.bigbytes.domain --token bv6105f53cb127087189cfib180a3131
```

### `bigbytes config set-project`

Choose the project you're developing in so the CLI knows which project content to look at for other commands like `bigbytes validate` and `bigbytes preview`. If your organization only has one project you won't need to use this!

```
bigbytes config set-project
```

This command will bring up an interactive list of projects in your organization to choose from.

If you need to set the project non-interactively, you can use one of the two optional arguments below.

**Options:**

* `--name`
   * Set the project non-interactively by passing an explicit project name
* `--uuid`
   * Set the project non-interactively by passing an explicit project UUID

**Examples:**

Set project to "Healthcare Demo":

```
bigbytes config set-project --name "Healthcare Demo"
```

Set project to the one with this UUID:

```
bigbytes config set-project --uuid "d75379bc-f6e9-4e52-86b2-d897cabacd0c"
```

### `bigbytes compile`

Compile Bigbytes resources using your local project and database credentials. dbt gets compiled first, then your Bigbytes explores. If you use [dbt node selection](#dbt-node-selection) to only compile a subset of models, Bigbytes will also compile models joined to those models to ensure no field references are broken.

All standard [dbt options](#dbt-options) work with `bigbytes compile`.

**Examples:**

Compile the whole project:

```
bigbytes compile
```

Compile only the `accounts` dbt model, then your Bigbytes explores:

```
bigbytes compile -s accounts
```

Compile your project using the `production` profile from your local `profiles.yml` file:

```
bigbytes compile --profile production
```

### `bigbytes preview`

Spin up a temporary preview project using your local project files and content (charts and dashboards) copied from your [selected project](#bigbytes-config-set-project).

All standard [dbt options](#dbt-options) work with `bigbytes preview`.

**Options:**

* `--name [preview name]`
   * Custom name for the preview project. If a name is not provided, a unique, randomly generated name will be created.
* `--start-of-week [number]`
   * Specifies the first day of the week (used by week-related date functions).
   * 0 (Monday) to 6 (Sunday)
* `--skip-dbt-compile`
   * (default: false)
   * Skip `dbt compile` and deploy from the existing ./target/manifest.json
* `--skip-warehouse-catalog`
   * (default: false)
   * Skip fetch warehouse catalog and use types defined in the YAML.
* `--use-dbt-list [true/false]`
   * (default: true)
   * Use `dbt list` instead of `dbt compile` to generate dbt manifest.json
* `--ignore-errors`
   * (default: false)
   * Allows deploy with errors on compile

**Examples:**

Create a temporary preview project with the name **PR: Add Revenue Metric** and ignore validation errors while spinning it up:

```
bigbytes preview --name "PR: Add Revenue Metric" --ignore errors

```

Create a temporary preview project with a random name and set the start of week to Monday, only include models with the dbt tag of `marketing`:

```
bigbytes preview --start-of-week=0 --select "tag:marketing"
```

### `bigbytes start-preview`

Create a persistent preview project using your local project files and content (charts and dashboards) copied from your [selected project](#bigbytes-config-set-project).

All standard [dbt options](#dbt-options) work with `bigbytes start-preview`.

**Required argument:**

* `--name [preview name]`
   * Name for the preview project. If a preview project with this name already exists, it will be updated, otherwise it will create a new preview project.

**Options:**

* `--start-of-week [number]`
   * Specifies the first day of the week (used by week-related date functions).
   * 0 (Monday) to 6 (Sunday)
* `--skip-dbt-compile`
   * (default: false)
   * Skip `dbt compile` and deploy from the existing ./target/manifest.json
* `--skip-warehouse-catalog`
   * (default: false)
   * Skip fetch warehouse catalog and use the types defined in YAML
* `--use-dbt-list [true/false]`
   * (default: true)
   * Use `dbt list` instead of `dbt compile` to generate dbt manifest.json
* `--ignore-errors`
   * (default: false)
   * Allows deploy with errors on compile

### `bigbytes stop-preview`

Shuts down a project that was created with [bigbytes start-preview](#bigbytes-start-preview).

This command does not support using dbt options.

**Required argument:**

* `--name [preview name]`
   * Name of the preview project to be deleted.

**Example:**

Shut down the preview project named **neon unicorn**.

```
bigbytes stop-preview "neon unicorn"

```

### `bigbytes deploy`

Compiles and deploys the current project to your [selected Bigbytes Cloud project](#bigbytes-config-set-project).

<Warning>
**DANGER**

This command is usually [used in Github Actions](/guides/cli/how-to-use-bigbytes-deploy#automatically-deploy-your-changes-to-bigbytes-using-a-github-action) or other deploy scripts. It is not common practice to use `bigbytes deploy` to push your local changes up to Bigbytes Cloud outside of your initial project creation.
</Warning>

All standard [dbt options](#dbt-options) work with `bigbytes deploy`.

**Options:**

* `--create [project_name]`
   * Create a new project. If a project name is not provided, you'll be prompted for one on creation.
* `--ignore-errors`
   * (default: false)
   * Allows deploy with errors on compile.
* `--start-of-week [number]`
   * Specifies the first day of the week (used by week-related date functions).
   * 0 (Monday) to 6 (Sunday)
* `--skip-dbt-compile`
   * (default: false)
   * Skip `dbt compile` and deploy from the existing ./target/manifest.json.
* `--skip-warehouse-catalog`
   * (default: false)
   * Skip fetch warehouse catalog and use types defined in the YAML.
* `--use-dbt-list [true|false]`
   * (default: true)
   * Use `dbt list` instead of `dbt compile` to generate dbt manifest.json.

### `bigbytes refresh`

Refreshes your hosted Bigbytes project using the latest code from your linked Github repository. This is equivalent to pressing **Refresh dbt** in the UI as an admin.

This command does not support using dbt options.

### `bigbytes validate`

Validates a project by comparing the content in your currently selected project against your local project files. Returns all charts and dashboards that have errors.

All standard [dbt options](#dbt-options) work with `bigbytes validate`.

**Options:**

* `--project [project uuid]`
   * Project UUID to validate, if not provided, the last preview will be used
* `--preview`
   * (default: false)
   * Validate the last preview if available.
* `--skip-dbt-compile`
   * (default: false)
   * Skip `dbt compile` and deploy from the existing ./target/manifest.json.
* `--skip-warehouse-catalog`
   * (default: false)
   * Skip fetch warehouse catalog and use types defined in the YAML.
* `--use-dbt-list [true/false]`
   * (default: true)
   * Use `dbt list` instead of `dbt compile` to generate dbt manifest.json.
* `--only [elems...]`
   * (default: \["charts","dashboards","tables"\])
   * Specify project elements to validate.

**Example:**

Validate only dashboards and use the existing compiled dbt manifest:

```
bigbytes validate --only ["dashboards"] --skip-dbt-compile

```

### `bigbytes generate`

Generates a new `schema.yml` file or updates existing `schema.yml` for selected model(s).

All standard [dbt options](#dbt-options) work with `bigbytes generate`.

**Options:**

* `-y` or `--assume-yes`
   * (default: false)
   * assume yes to prompts
* `--exclude-meta`
   * (default: false)
   * exclude Bigbytes metadata from the generated .yml

**Example:**

Generate or update YAML file for a single dbt model to cover all columns in the database:

```
bigbytes generate -s mymodel

```

### `bigbytes generate-exposures`

Generates a `schema.yml` file for Bigbytes exposures.

<Warning>
**DANGER**

This command is still in beta and may be removed or updated without warning.
</Warning>

This command does not support using dbt options.

**Options:**

* `--project-dir [path]`
   * (default: ".")
   * The directory of the dbt project
* `--output [path]`
   * The path where the output exposures YAML file will be written

**Example:**

Create or update YAML file called `bigbytes-exposures.yml` in the current directory with all exposures in Bigbytes:

```
bigbytes generate-exposures --output ./bigbytes-exposures.yml

```

### `bigbytes dbt run`

Runs dbt and then generates or updates `schema.yml` file(s) for models that have columns missing or changed from the existing `schema.yml` files.

Any dbt option that works with `dbt run` will also work with `bigbytes dbt run`. That includes all the [Bigbytes dbt options](#dbt-options), and more ([see dbt run docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/commands/run)).

**Options:**

* `--exclude-meta`
   * (default: false)
   * exclude Bigbytes metadata from the generated .yml
* `-y` or `--assume-yes`
   * assume yes to prompts (default: false)

**Examples:**

Run a single model and create or update its `schema.yml` file:

```bash
bigbytes dbt run --select mymodel
```

### `bigbytes download`

Downloads all charts and dashboards from your Bigbytes project as code. A `bigbytes` directory is created in your working directory and all of the charts and dashboards are written there as .yml files.

E.g. if you're running this command inside your dbt directory (eg: `/home/javi/dbt`) then it will create a folder (`/home/javi/dbt/bigbytes`).

You can make changes to the code and upload these changes back to your Bigbytes project. Content that's been downloaded as code can still be managed in the Bigbytes UI.

**Examples:**

Download all charts and dashboards from your project.

```
bigbytes download
```

### `bigbytes upload`

Uploads charts and dashboards that you've made changes to from the `bigbytes/` directory in your dbt project to your Bigbytes project. To upload new content as code to your project, you need to use the option `--force` (see **Options** below).

If there have been changes made to a chart or dashboard in the application that is being uploaded from code, `bigbytes upload` will overwrite the changes.

**Options:**

* `--force`
   * if you've created new content as code that doesn't exist in your Bigbytes project yet, you need to run `bigbytes upload --force` to create these new charts and dashboards. Otherwise, `bigbytes upload` only uploads updates to existing content.

**Examples:**

Upload all charts and dashboards in code from your `bigbytes/` directory to your Bigbytes project.

```
bigbytes upload
```

## dbt options

These are options from the dbt Core CLI that also work with some Bigbytes CLI commands.

### dbt node selection
You can select a subset of your dbt models by using the following options on any Bigbytes commands that support dbt options.

**Node selection:**

* `--select [models...]` or `-s [models...]`
   * [Read the dbt docs on select](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/node-selection/syntax#shorthand)
* `--exclude [models...]`
   * [Read the dbt docs on exclude](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/node-selection/exclude)
* `--selector [selector_name]`
   * [Read the dbt docs on selector](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/node-selection/yaml-selectors)

### dbt flags

These dbt flags work with Bigbytes commands that support dbt options. [Read the dbt docs on global config flags](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/global-configs/about-global-configs#available-flags) for details.

* `--project-dir [path]`
* `--profiles-dir [path]`
* `--profile [name]`
* `--target [name]`
* `--no-version-check`
* `--state [state]`
* `--full-refresh`

### dbt project variables

You can set dbt project variables in Bigbytes commands that support dbt options. [Read the dbt docs on project variables](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/project-variables) for details.

`--vars [vars]`

### dbt threads

You can set the number of threads for dbt in Bigbytes commands that support dbt options. [Read the dbt docs on threads](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/running-a-dbt-project/using-threads) for details.

`--threads [number]`
